CS213: Projects 1-3

A fitness chain has gyms at 5 different locations in the central New Jersey area:
  - Bridgewater, 08807, Somerset County
  - Edison, 08837, Middlesex County
  - Franklin, 08873, Somerset County
  - Piscataway, 08854, Middlesex County
  - Somerville, 08876, Somerset County

GymManager is a simple software that helps the fitness chain manage the gym memberships and fitness class schedules.

The fitness chain provides fitness classes at each of their gyms and three membership optionsâ€“standard, family, and premium. The software shall run the membership fee dues for all the members. Standard members can only check into fitness classes offered at the location where they are registered. Family and Premium members can check into any fitness class at any location, regardless of registered location. Family members also have 1 guest pass and Premium members have 3 guest passes. Guests (like standard members) can only check into fitness classes offered at the location where the member whose guest pass is being used is registered.
